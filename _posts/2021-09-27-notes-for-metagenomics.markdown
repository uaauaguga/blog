### Metagenomic profiling
- Estimate abundance of different microbes from amplicon sequencing or shutgun sequencing
- Assign reads to reference sequences

- alignment based methods vs. kmer based methods

- marker gene based methods vs. marker gene independent methodss

- nucleotide level analysis vs. protein level analysis

### Assembly

- metaspades
- megahit
- idba-ud


### Binning



### Strategy for removing contaminations


### Genome similarity

- mash distance
- whole genome alignment


### Distance metrics for microbe community
- Bray-Curtis distance
- unifrac distance
- weighted unifrac distance
- PCoA and Permnova Analysis 



### Differential analysis


### Functional annotation


### Visualization

### Genome annotation
- CDS prediction for prokaryotes
- CDS prediction for eukaryotes


- No update for a month ... Write something to demonstrate I still alive despite for its insiganificance...
